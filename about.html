      <p class="textTitle">Project Description</p>
      <p class="text">Under the era of COVID, especially the widespread lockdown in Shanghai, 
        people can hardly get out of their residence and experience the charm of photography. 
        Due to the variety of the internet and web, we can browse the scene outside of the house even outside of the country with just one click. 
        In this case, not only the beautiful and fascinating scenery should be taken, but also the experience of recording them. 
        This inspired me to create this project. To me, the charm of photography is not only the beauty recorded by the film or the sensor. 
        More importantly, the whole procedure starts with capturing the scene I want, finding the proper composition, 
        setting the parameters of the camera, then pressing the shutter button is the thing that attracts me to photography. 
        In this project, I want the audience to feel the charming procedure of photography as I am 
        through reforming the experience of taking the photo through live cams all over the world. 
        In addition, I want to introduce some of my photography works through the website, 
        and let the audience feel the emotion contained in my photos.</p>
